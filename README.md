# Optimal-locations-of-electric-public-charging-stations
With the raising concern about environmental pollution, using electric vehicles (EVs) is one direction that is believed to be the future standard of transportation. While the idea itself is not new and the legal framework is already there to support it, the implementation of it still progresses very slowly. There are multiple reasons for this slow growth, one of the major reasons is the lack of charging stations, which makes it very hard to convince the people of it over traditional vehicles using fossil fuel. With that in mind, in this paper, we propose an optimization model for setting up charging stations in the city of Cincinnati. Our objective is to satisfy the projected demand of charging at minimum investment. We do that by locating a number of candidate locations, then forming an integer programming model to choose the final suitable spots for implementation.
